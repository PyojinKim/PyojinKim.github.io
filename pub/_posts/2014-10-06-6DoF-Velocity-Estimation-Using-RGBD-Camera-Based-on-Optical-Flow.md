In this paper, we suggest a new 6-DoF velocity estimation algorithm using RGB and depth images.
Autonomous control of mobile robots requires their velocity information.
There exist numerous researches on estimating and measuring the velocity.
However, more investigations are needed related to vision sensors and depth image.
In this work, we propose an algorithm for velocity estimation with an RGB-D sensor based on image jacobian matrix usually used in image-based visual servoing.
We validate the performance of the proposed estimation algorithm in various environments with the RGB-D benchmark dataset.
The velocity estimation results show the high quality of estimated 6-DoF velocity compared to the ground truth velocity.
