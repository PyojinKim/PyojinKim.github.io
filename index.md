I am thrilled to be a postdoctoral fellow in [GrUVi Lab](http://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yasutaka Furukawa](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~furukawa/) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/).
Current areas of focus include robotics and 3D visual computing, AR/VR, geometric and image-based modeling, machine learning, inference and optimization.


In spring 2019, I defended my PhD thesis on [Low-Drift Visual Odometry for Indoor Robotics]({{ base_path }}/pub/Low-Drift-Visual-Odometry-for-Indoor-Robotics).
My advisor at [SNU](http://en.snu.ac.kr/) within the [Lab for Autonomous Robotics Research (LARR)](http://larr.snu.ac.kr/) was [Prof. H. Jin Kim](http://larr.snu.ac.kr/index.php/people/).


My research interests in robotics and AI are **Robust Visual Odometry** [[1]], **Visual Localization** [[2]],
**Low-Drift Visual Odometry** [[3],[4]], and **Drift-Free Rotation Estimation** [[4],[5]] in structured environments.
